Logical operators are used to determine the logic between variables or values.

Given that x = 6 and y = 3, the table below explains the logical operators:

Operator	Description	Example	Try it
&&	and	(x < 10 && y > 1) is true	
||	or	(x == 5 || y == 5) is false	
!	not	!(x == y) is true

  let a = 10;

  if (a < 10 && a > 15) {
    console.log("execute");
